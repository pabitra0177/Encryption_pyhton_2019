# Project Title :- Encrypto

Encrypto is your personal Encryptor and decryptor. It comes in a suitable UI made with PyQt5. Encrypto doesn't only operate on text files, it goes way beyond that. And also incase you forgot your key , it gives you log file, which of course is not in any encrypted form.   

## Getting Started
So to get started you need python 3.x and some py-modules in your system.

### Prerequisites

First you need to install PyQt5, that runs the UI:-

```
pip install pyqt5
```
Then the crypto-module pycrypto should to be installed
```
pip install pycrypto
    'or'
pip install pycryptodome
```
* the later one especially for windows 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
