# Encryption_pyhton_2019
* Encrypto is basically a tool to do encryption and decryption using AES and DES3.

Features:-
1) It has a UI made with PyQt5
2) User has choice to choose among the two methodes .
3) It supports 2 step-user-key system and key verification
4) There is an additional methode to have a log file, which stores key 'n' details
5) User explicitly has to choose the output folder and there is a default log file which can be changed
6) The code is written with Python Object Oriented Programing(OOPs).

Yet to be solved:-
1)  The repository which I have used is not supported in Windows(there is a similar repo but ...). So to create a clone of
    the Encrypto.py that will run in a Windows system

**** I need help in creating an .exe file that will run in a windows system and also a msi file **********
(
  When I'm trying to create an exe in my ubuntu system the output file didn't work in windows
  So how to do that ???
